"Bar" Graphs -- Global Alcohol Consumption 

# Proposal
- A small (800kgal/ year) American Vodka producer looking to expand globally.  Where should they start to position themselves and what might next steps be?

# Method
- Cleaned multiple API-downloaded dataframes using Python and Excel. Merged and created subsidiary dataframes to work on smaller parts of the data.
- Reviewed Regional prospects, then country by country for a chosen top 3.
- Reviewed demographics (age and gender), consumption trends, and forecast pricing by creating CPI multiplier and linear regression.

# Goals
- 3 target regions, countries, and price 
- How does gender and age affect consumption patterns?
- What do household expenditures on alcohol look like? Is there possible room for growth?
- What is market share?
- Can we forecast a retail price range?

# Conclusions
- Targeting Canada, Australia, and Estonia with expected pricing noted in slide deck. 

# Limitations
- Free data is not up to date. We needed to forecast pricing from 2012, and rely on population and demographic data that ended in 2015-2018.
- The price of alcohol is not directly correlated with country CPI pricing.
- Spirits pricing includes luxury labels and aged spirits like whisky which skew pricing high.
