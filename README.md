# SMU_BootCamp_-Project_1
This is the First Project for the SMU bootcamp 

Proposal:
World alcohol consumption per capita by Country and type of alcohol compared to GDP, life expectancy.
What insights can we gain? Are income, life expectancy,  and alcohol consumption correlated?

Goals
What are the demographics of consumers who purchase alcohol?
How are these demographics changing over time?
How do consumer preferences vary across different demographics? (age, gender, income, etc.)
