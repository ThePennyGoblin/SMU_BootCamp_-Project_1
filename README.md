"Bar" Graphs -- Global Alcohol Consumption 

# Proposal
- A small (2ML/ year) American Vodka producer looking to expand globally.  Where should they start to position themselves and what might next steps be? 

# Goals
- 3 target regions, countries, and price 
- How does gender and age affect consumption patterns?
- What do household expenditures on alcohol look like? Is there possible room for growth?
