"Bar" Graphs -- Global Alcohol Consumption 

# Goals
- Are income, life expectancy,  and alcohol consumption correlated?
- What are the demographics of consumers who purchase alcohol?
- How are these demographics changing over time?
- How do consumer preferences vary across different demographics? (age, gender, income, etc.)
- How does this relate to household income and the price of alcohol?
